# KIV/CPP

This is a repository for my KIV/CPP course - Programming in C++.

## Cviceni

Contains code for exercises from the course. Building and running the code is
handled by the `just` command runner using `clang`:

- `just build <exercise>` - build exercise
- `just run <exercise> [args]` - build and run exercise
- `just valgrind <exercise> [args]` - build and run exercise with valgrind

## Semestralky

Contains two semester projects:

- [Drawing shapes from text commands](semestralky/sem01/README.md)
- [Library for a multi-precision arithmetic and a simple calculator frontend](semestralky/sem02/README.md)
